# INSTALLATION - PREREQUISITES

### Installation Option 1: For development (or if you use Windows or Mac)
This option involves installing a virtual machine. It will take an hour or two but its truly worth it! 
Simple instructions here => https://gist.github.com/JeffreyWay/af0ee7311abfde3e3b73
Skip step 2 and step 3 in the instructions. Instead simply cd to your desired directory in the Terminal, and run this command:
```
curl -L -o 'install.sh' http://bit.ly/1hBfq57 && curl -L -o 'Vagrantfile' http://bit.ly/1mE3Qt9 && vagrant up
```

### Installation Option 2: For Production (or if you use Linux)

Step 1: [Install a LAMP stack] 
(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-14-04)

Step 2: [Install Laravel] (https://laravel.com/docs/master)


# INSTALLATION 

Run the following commands in a suitable directory (e.g. Apache's docRoot)

```
git clone https://github.com/brightniyonzima/laravel.git
cd laravel
composer install
edit the env file in the root folder to suit your database details e.g your database name, username, password
run the command 'php artisan migrate' to create all associated tables of the application
```

## Recommendations 
1: After installation or any upgrade on any packages, always type 'composer dump-autoload' in your terminal to refresh
2: Be careful when using comments in php blade files as at times laravel 5.3 seems to ignore that comments are comments
